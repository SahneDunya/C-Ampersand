# C Ampersand
C Ampersand is a programming language developed by Sahne Dünya for the Sahne64 ecosystem. What is Sahne64? Sahne64 is the most important API of Sahne Karnal architecture developed by Sahne Dünya. This API provides Kernel and Userspace communication. However, do not confuse it with the following When examining the source file of the C Ampersand programming language, do not misunderstand the function of the Header file related to Sahne64 because the main source file of Sahne64 is located in Sahne Karnal and Sahne Karnal was developed with the Rust programming language, while C Ampersand was developed with the classical C language. As you know, since Rust is not directly compatible with C, the C Header file related to Sahne64 is actually a source code that allows us to use the Sahne64 API in the C language, so these are not really the main source code of the Sahne64 API! In addition, each C software has its own unique Sahne64 Header source file. But it is not limited to just the Header file, as you know Sahne64 is normally written in Rust. A separate Sahne64 file is created to use Sahne64 in a programming language other than Rust, and these codes are specific to the software. But the main source file of Sahne64 is in Kernel which is in Sahne Karnal series, it is lower level, it can do more operations, it can serve more software, it is stored under a single standard! If you are developing software written with Rust for Sahne Karnal, you need to use Sahne64 specific functions, but you do not need to download the source file of Sahne64 library because it will be provided by the kernel. However, this does not eliminate the need for C Ampersand programming language. The main purpose of C Ampersand programming language is to be the main language of Sahne64 ecosystem, so what is the important role here. Normally, Sahne64 calling in Rust language is manual and there is a need to write lower level code and it is not used frequently by application developers and is generally preferred in operating system components using Sanla Karnal architecture! C Ampersand programming language makes it easier to develop applications for Sahne Karnal architecture operating systems and offers more abstraction layers.

# C Ampersand
It is a programming language developed by Sahne Dünya for the Sahne64 ecosystem. What is Sahne64? Sahne64 is the most important API of Sahne Karnal architecture developed by Sahne Dünya. This API provides Kernel and Userspace communication. However, do not confuse it with this: When examining the source file of the C Ampersand programming language, do not misunderstand the function of the Header file related to Sahne64 because the main source file of Sahne64 is located in Sahne Karnal and Sahne Karnal is developed with the Rust programming language, while C Ampersand is developed with the classical C language. However, there is a problem, how could Sahne64 normally be used in the C language, the API developed for Rust. In Sahne Karnal, Sahne64.rs is the main file, and next to it you will see Sahne.h, main.c, main.cpp and main.d files. When you examine the Sahne64.rs file, you will find the codes related to the compatibility layer at the end, and then the other codes provide compatibility with C, C++ and D programming languages. That's why C Ampersand could be developed with the C language. The purpose of the C Ampersand programming language is to develop applications for the Sahne Karnal architecture. Normally Sahne64 is the API that provides communication between the kernel and the user area, so according to this, the desktop environment, file system, package manager, installation system, etc. are expected. Where did the application come from? In fact, normally Applications and Games are the operating system's user area software. Since C Ampersand is developed for application development, it is easier to use than Rust, C, C++ and D languages ​​because Sahne64 is automatically included in the code, while others require manual calling, and also some features make the C Ampersand language easier to use.

# C Ampersand What is the difference between the programming languages ​​Rust and C/C++?
1. Memory management: In C/C++ language, memory is managed manually, in Rust programming language, it uses memory management that follows the principle of ownership and borrowing, in C Ampersand programming language, it uses automatic memory management that follows the principle of garbage collection, thanks to this, programming is easier but there are performance losses.
2. Based on: Classic C language is based on B programming language, C++ is based on Classic C language, Rust programming language is based on C/C++. C Ampersand is based on Rust and Classic C language.
3.Purpose of creation: The main purpose of the classical C language is to meet the need for system programming, the main purpose of the Rust language is to facilitate the development of secure, concurrent and high-performance systems. The main purpose of the C Ampersand language is to be the main programming language of the Sahne64 ecosystem.
4. Platform support: Classic C/C++ and Rust are completely platform independent, while C Ampersand is heavily dependent on Sahne64, which means that Sahne is heavily dependent on operating systems that use the Karnal architecture, meaning it is not platform independent.
5. Abstraction layer: C and Rust languages ​​are lower level as they are focused on system programming. C Ampersand is a higher level language as it is more focused on Application development!
